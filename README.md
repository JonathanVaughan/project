### Introduction
The aim for this project was to create a fully functioning CRUD apllication with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.
For my project I chose to make a Pizza Delivery application that would allow a user to order a pizza to there home


## Project Tracking
I used Trello to track my project (shown below)

## ERD
This was my first draft of my ERD which shows  the relationships and the cloumns of my SQL database

During development my entity relationship diagram changed due to time constraints some of the features I initially wanted i was unable to complete.

#### Technologies Used
* Trello: for project tracking
* Github: Version Control System, and Jenkins WebHook
* Google Cloud Platform: Virtual Machine for application and SQL Database
* Mysql: Allows creation of SQL Databases and Tables
* Jenkins: Continuous Integration Server builds application after every push to github
* PyTest: Tests code functions and offers coverage to see how much is tested
* Gunicorn: WSGI to run python web app


## Testing
Pytest was used for testing 
## Improvements for future
