### Introduction
The aim for this project was to create a fully functioning CRUD apllication with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.
For my project I chose to make a Pizza Delivery application that would allow a user to order a pizza to there home


## Project Tracking
I used Trello to track my project (shown below)


## ERD
This was my first draft of my ERD which shows  the relationships and the cloumns of my SQL database

During development my entity relationship diagram changed due to time constraints some of the features I initially wanted i was unable to complete.
